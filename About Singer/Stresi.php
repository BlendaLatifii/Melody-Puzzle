           <b>Stresi</b> is a very popular singer and songwriter. 
           Arkimed Lushaj, known as Stresi, was born in Vlora and then his family moved to Tirana where he spent most of his childhood until the family left for Belgium. 
           During these years, he sang and performed in several shows that were organized for Albanians in the diaspora. 
           Lived there for several years until 2007. In addition to being in Belgium, Stresi also lived in Italy for several years. 
           The chapka boy had tried to leave with his friends for Greece, so his mother called him "Stress". 
           He is the youngest child and has one sister and one brother. 
           Stresi has completed higher studies in Psychology, although he has never practiced the profession. 
           The collaborations throughout the career are numerous and the current manager is Flor Bana. 
           Today, Stresi has many well-known friends such as Fero, Il Ghost, Morena Taraku, 2Ton, Ledri Vula, Getinjo, etc. 
           He started his career in 2007, when he was 20 years old. 
           In 2012, Stresi was the musical ally of the Babastars label, but the alliance was destroyed in 2020 when Ghetto Geasy and Mike dissed Stresi with the song "Hajde Te Baba". 
           Stress returns the diss with the song "Po Foli i Fundit". 
           Stresi is also the founder of the music label "BadBoys4Life". 
           Members of the "BadBoys4Life" label are One T, Anestezion, Pakufijt, Enes Qosa and Flor Bana. 
           Stresi has participated in several festivals where it has been awarded prizes. 
           In addition to music, Stresi will soon open his own clothing brand called "BadBoysForLifeBrand" where he will sell his brand online.
