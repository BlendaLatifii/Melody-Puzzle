           <b>Noizy</b>  is a very popular singer and songwriter. 
           Real name Rigels Rajku, but known by everyone as Noizy. 
           He signed a contract with the famous company "Universal Music" and already Noizy has become one of the most paid artists in the Albanian territory. 
           He has a very different style from other Albanian rappers. 
           Today, he has many well-known friends such as the actor Blerim Destani, Xhevdet Jashari, MC Kresha and DUDA, but for Noizy, it has not always been such a field and flower as it is today. 
           In 1997, when Noizy was only 11 years old, he left Albania with his family for a better life in London (South East, Wooldwhich). 
           In the neighborhood where Noizy was stabilized there were more wars between clans. At that time, Wooldwhich was known as one of the most dangerous ghetto neighborhoods in London where the bigger fish eats the smaller and where the word mercy did not exist for a very long time. 
           Noizy is the London champion in "street fight" with 15 matches - 15 wins. 
           Inspired by the daily way of life in the past makes him hungry for success. 
           In addition to music, he now also has the clothing brand "Illyrian Bloodline" with which he sold his brand through the Internet with shipping anywhere in the world and with 3 sales points in DurrÃ«s, Pristina and finally in Prizren.
